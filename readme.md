Alpine.js offers you the reactive and declarative nature of big frameworks like Vue or React at a much lower cost.

You get to keep your DOM, and sprinkle in behavior as you see fit.

Think of it like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for JavaScript.

> Note: This tool's syntax is almost entirely borrowed from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (and by extension [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)). I am forever grateful for the gift they are to the web.

## Overview

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in [Go][].
It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.
